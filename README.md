# Training and Deploying YOLO Model with Ultralytics for AI-Powered Photo Organization
Repo for AI/ML project on training YOLO Models on Images.

This project aims to create an API that automatically creates albums based on the content of your photos. It uses machine learning models to recognize patterns, like people, objects, and scenes, and then suggests albums like 'nature,' 'city life,' or '[person's name].' Users can then confirm or deny these suggestions, making it easier to search and organize their photo libraries. For the purposes of this repository, I will briefly explain how you can train your own model and you can test out my model.

I have created a proof of concept, where a model was training to recognize two different people within a photo library.

## Model Example
Here's an example of it running inferences on me:
